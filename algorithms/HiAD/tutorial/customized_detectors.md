# Custom Detector
  
The `hiad.detectors.base.BaseDetector` class serves as a wrapper for detectors in HiAD. You can create a custom detector by inheriting from this class.  
  
  
Initialize the detector
```
from hiad.detectors.base import BaseDetector
from typing import List, Union
import torch
import logging

class CustomizedDetector(BaseDetector):

    def __init__(self,
                 other_params,

                 logger: logging.Logger = None,

        r"""
           Args:
               other_params: Define the parameters required by the anomaly detection algorithm; they should match those provided in the config.
               patch_size (int or list): Image patch resolution.
               device (torch.Device): Computing device in PyTorch.
               fusion_weights (list): Fusion weights used for multi-resolution feature fusion. This functionality is implemented in `BaseDetector`, so you only need to pass the weights to `BaseDetector`.
               logger (logging.Logger): Logger object
               seed (int): random seed.
               early_stop_epochs (int): Controls early stopping during training: 
                        if the detector shows no performance improvement over N epochs, 
                        training will stop early. If set to -1, early stopping is disabled.

Define the data preprocessing pipeline by implementing the `create_dataset` method.

                        Some key attributes included in the `LRPatch` class are:

               evaluators: Evaluation methods.
               The `checkpoint_path`, `val_dataloader`, and `evaluators` are used during the model validation and checkpoint saving. 
               The `val_step` method in `BaseDetector` already provides a basic implementation of the validation and checkpoint-saving process, 
               which can be directly invoked using the following code:
                    best_metrics = {}
                    best_metrics = self.val_step(val_dataloader, evaluators, checkpoint_path, best_metrics)
               `best_metrics` Contains the best validation metrics recorded so far.
               Once the `embedding` method is implemented, you can directly obtain multi-resolution fusion features using the `get_multi_resolution_fusion_embeddings` method provided in `BaseDetector`.
               Use multi-resolution fused features instead of the original pre-trained features for anomaly detection:
               for data in train_dataloader:
                   features = self.get_multi_resolution_fusion_embeddings(data)
                   # The shape of `features` is the same as that of the original features. ([B,C1,H1,W1], [B,C2,H2,W2], ..., [B,Cn,Hn,Wn])
           return:
                Returns a boolean: `True` if the checkpoint has already been saved; `False` if not, which will trigger the `trainer` to perform the save.
